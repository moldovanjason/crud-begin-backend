"# crud-begin-backend" 

crud-begin-backend is the backend secion of crud-begin-font.
The primary languages I've used in this project are Node.js, Express and mysql.
I used a 3rd party appliction called mysql workbench to visual see the database i created.
I use express for easier use to create database tables.

Deployed the backend with heroku.
I create api's in the backend to dynamicly manipulate the dom.
Api's for adding new employees, updating a single employees wage and deleting an individual employee.
