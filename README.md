"# crud-begin-backend" 

employee-management-system-backend is the backend secion of crud-begin-font.
The primary languages I've used in this project are Node.js, Express and mysql.
I used a 3rd party appliction called mysql workbench to visual see the database i created.
I use express for easier use to create database tables.

Deployed the backend with heroku.
I create api's in the backend to dynamicly manipulate the dom.
Api's for adding new employees, updating a single employees wage and deleting an individual employee.

Using 5 differnt inputs to store in 5 differnt react hooks to then submit into the data base using the add employee button.
Using axios post request to send all data stored from the react hooks from the frontend to the backend and then store into the database then back to the frontend mapping through another hook to display the data onto the browser.
